## Q. What is JSX?

A: JSX is an javaScript extension **HTML-Like** or **XML-Like** syntax.

- JSX is not tied to React, nor is React ties to JSX. Both are separate.
- JSX is an alternate way of writng `React.createElement();`
- JSX is not an valid pure javaScript syntax. JS engine can't directly understand the JSX syntax.
- JSX is need to be **transpiled** before it goes to the JS Engine.
- If you have to give attributes to JSX, you have to use `camelCase` for e.g., `class => className`, `tabindex => tabIndex`, etc.
- JSX in multi-line is not a valid JavaScript, so we need to wrapped it inside round braces `()` while writting multi line JSX.
The round brackets `()` helps babel (transpiler) understand the starting and ending of an JSX syntax.
- You can also execute any JavaScript expression within JSX, by wrapping it inside curcly barces `{}`.
- JSX take care of any injection attacks as well. For example: if a API passed some malicious data into our code, the JSX will not blindly run it, rather it will escapse it.
  - JSX Sanitize the data before processing the JavaScript extension wrapped inside the curcly braces `{}`.
  - JSX also prevent cross-side scripting attacks.

> - üí° Transpile - converting the code into what browser can understand

## Q. What kind of language does the JS engine understand?

A: ECMA Script

## Q. If JSX is not a pure javaScript then how come then the browser understand and render JSX syntax?

A: The JSX is transpiled into the one that browser can understand using a compiler like `Babel` and then forwarded to JS engine.
Essentially, HTML is unaware of Components or JSX. Before React code reaches the browser, it is compiled or transpiled into standard HTML, which is then rendered by the browser.

## Q. What are two ways of creating a React component?

A: Class Based Component (old) and Functional Component (new)

## Q. What is React functional Component?

A: React Functional Component is just a normal JavaScript function that's return a piece of JSX (ReactElement)

> üí°Important: Always remember to use PascalCase in naming React Component. Its a react way of knowing that what is component and what is not.

## Q. What's the difference between React Element and React Component?

A:

- Representation:
  - An element is a description of what should be rendered, while a component is a function or class that produces elements.
- Mutability:
  - Elements are immutable, while components can manage their own state and behavior.
- Reusability:
  - Components are reusable building blocks, while elements are specific instances of UI elements.
- Lifecycle:
  - Components have a lifecycle (mounting, updating, unmounting), while elements do not.
- Rendering:
  - Elements are rendered by React to the DOM, while components are invoked to produce elements.

## Q. What is Component Composition?

A: Nesting a component within one another OR, composing two components into one another.

## Q. What makes your webapp code readable, fater, and understandable?

A: People usually say its React! But in actually your code is readable, and understandable because you are writting JSX and JSX is not React!

## Theory Assignment Q&A

### Q: What is JSX?

A: JSX stands for `JavaScript XML`, It allows developers to write HTML-like code in JavaScript without writing createElement in React which makes React code more confusing and inefficient. JSX is not part of React. JSX makes it easier to add HTML in React. JSX converts HTML code into JavaScript code that React can understand and renders in the DOM. React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX.

Here's a simple example of JSX:

```js
  const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
```

In the above code, looks like HTML, but it's JSX. When this code is transpiled, it turns into JavaScript code that creates a React element, which can be rendered in a React application.

---

### Q: Rules of JSX

A: **1. Return a single root element** - To return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag.
For instance, We can use <div>

```html
<div>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg"
    alt="Hedy Lamarr"
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
```

If you don‚Äôt want to add an extra <div> to your markup, you can write <> and </> instead

```jsx
<>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg"
    alt="Hedy Lamarr"
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</>
```

This empty tag is called a **Fragment**. Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.

**2. Close all the tags**
JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like <img> must become <img />, and wrapping tags like `<li>oranges must be written as <li>oranges</li>`.

```jsx
<>
  <img
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg"
    alt="Hedy Lamarr"
    class="photo"
   />
  <ul>
    <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
    <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
    <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
  </ul>
</>
```

### Q: Superpowers of JSX?

A: `Integration of HTML-like Syntax` - JSX allows us to write code that looks like HTML in JavaScript. This makes it easy for developers to create user interfaces.

`Component-Based Structure` - JSX is especially powerful when used with libraries like React. It enables us to create reusable UI components, making our code more modular and maintainable.

`Dynamic Data Binding` - We can embed JavaScript expressions inside JSX using curly braces, allowing us to easily include and manipulate dynamic data within your user interfaces. JSX is easy to maintain and debug.

## Q: Role of `type` attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?

A: The `type` attribute specifies the type of the script. The type attribute identifies the content between the `<script>` and `</script>` tags. It has a Default value which is ‚Äútext/javascript‚Äù.

### `type` attribute can be of the following types

- `text/javascript` : It is the basic standard of writing javascript code inside the `<script>` tag.

  ```html
    <script type="text/javascript"></script>
  ```

- `text/ecmascript` : this value indicates that the script is following the `EcmaScript` standards.
- `module`: This value tells the browser that the script is a module that can import or export other files or modules inside it.
- `text/babel` : This value indicates that the script is a babel type and required bable to transpile it.
- `text/typescript`: As the name suggest the script is written in `TypeScript`.

## Q: `{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent/>}` vs `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in `JSX`.

A: The Difference is stated below:

- `{TitleComponent}`: This value describes the `TitleComponent` as a javascript expression or a variable.
The `{}` can embed a javascript expression or a variable inside it.
- `<TitleComponent/>` : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value. In simple terms `TitleComponent` a function that is returning a JSX value.
A component is written inside the `{<  />}` expression.
- `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` :  `<TitleComponent />` and `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` are equivalent only when `< TitleComponent />` has no child components. The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.

### Example

```jsx
<TitleComponent>
    <FirstChildComponent />
    <SecondChildComponent />
    <ThirdChildComponent />
</TitleComponent>
```
